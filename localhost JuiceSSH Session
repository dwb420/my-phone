[*] downgrade Replace a package with a lower version
configure-any Configure any package which may help this one
hold Process incidental packages even when on hold
not-root Try to (de)install things even when not root
bad-path PATH is missing important programs, problems likely
bad-verify Install a package even if it fails authenticity check
bad-version Process even packages with wrong versions

[!] confnew Always use the new config files, don't prompt
[!] confold Always use the old config files, don't prompt
[!] confdef Use the default option for new config files if one
is available, don't prompt. If no default can be found,
you will be prompted unless one of the confold or
confnew options is also given

apt 1.8.4 (arm64)
Usage: apt [options] command

apt is a commandline package manager and provides commands for
searching and managing as well as querying information about packages.
It provides the same functionality as the specialized APT tools,
like apt-get and apt-cache, but enables options more suitable for
interactive use by default.

Most used commands:
list - list packages based on package names
search - search in package descriptions
show - show package details
install - install packages
reinstall - reinstall packages
remove - remove packages
autoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages
update - update list of available packages
upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages
edit-sources - edit the source information file

See apt(8) for more information about the available commands.
Configuration options and syntax is detailed in apt.conf(5).
Information about how to configure sources can be found in sources.list(5).
Package and version choices can be expressed via apt_preferences(5).
Security details are available in apt-secure(8).
This APT has Super Cow Powers.

canonicalizes based on stored IP, if available,
rather than stored hostname

--lookup attempt to canonicalize hostnames via DNS
-m only hostname and user associated with stdin
-p, --process print active processes spawned by init
-q, --count all login names and number of users logged on
-r, --runlevel print current runlevel
-s, --short print only name, line, and time (default)
-t, --time print last system clock change
-T, -w, --mesg add user's message status as +, - or ?
-u, --users list users logged in
--message same as -T
--writable same as -T
--help display this help and exit
--version output version information and exit
